          The Agoot is a type of fish found in the Philippines, commonly associated with freshwater or brackish environments. It is known for its role in local diets and is often prepared in traditional Filipino dishes. Specific details about the
          species may vary by region, but the name "Agoot" is typically linked to indigenous or regional classifications of fish in the country.

            The Agoot, also known as the silver grunt, is commonly found in various regions across the Philippines. It inhabits shallow coastal waters, estuaries, mangroves, and areas with soft sediment near reefs. This makes it widely distributed in
            areas like Palawan, Mindoro, and other regions with rich estuarine ecosystems. The species is known for its adaptability to both marine and brackish environments, including occasional entry into freshwater zones.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Caught primarily by artisanal fishermen using nets and hook-and-line techniques, the Agoot is sold fresh in local markets and processed into dried or smoked products. It is highly valued for its mild flavor and versatility in Filipino
            cuisine, commonly featured in grilled, fried, or soup-based dishes. Fishing peaks during its spawning season from May to October, and sustainable management practices are important to avoid overfishing and habitat degradation.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Though prevalent in the Philippines, Pomadasys argenteus is distributed widely across the Indo-Pacific, including southern Japan, northern Australia, and parts of the Red Sea, making it an important fish in many regional fisheries.
